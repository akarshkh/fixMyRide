# Bug Fixes and Feature Implementation Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Service Request API Endpoints Fixed
**Problem**: Frontend was calling `/api/requests` but backend routes were at `/api/service-requests`
**Solution**: Updated all frontend API calls to use the correct endpoint
- `components/service-requests.tsx`: Updated all fetch calls from `/api/requests` to `/api/service-requests`
- Fixed response handling to work with both direct arrays and paginated responses

### 2. Remove Add Customer Button
**Problem**: Manual customer creation was still possible via UI button
**Solution**: Removed "Add Customer" button and replaced with informational text
- `components/customers.tsx`: Replaced the Add Customer button with explanatory text: "Customers are automatically created when service requests are made"

### 3. Enhanced Customer Display with Categories and Visit Counts
**Problem**: Customer categories and visit counts were not displayed in the frontend
**Solution**: Enhanced the customers interface to show:
- Visit count column
- Customer category badges (Frequent, Moderate, One-Time visitors)
- Category filtering dropdown
- Enhanced table structure with proper categorization

### 4. Implemented Category Filtering
**Problem**: No way to filter customers by visit frequency
**Solution**: Added category filter with options:
- All Categories
- Frequent Visitors (3+ visits)
- Moderate Visitors (2 visits) 
- One-Time Visitors (1 visit)

## Backend Logic Already Implemented

The backend already had robust customer auto-creation logic:

### Service Request Creation Process:
1. **Automatic Customer Detection**: When a service request is created, the system:
   - Searches for existing customer by phone number (primary identifier)
   - If found: Increments visit count, updates last service date
   - If not found: Creates new customer with visit count = 1

2. **Customer Categorization**: Customers are automatically categorized based on visit count:
   - **Frequent Visitors**: 3+ visits (‚≠ê green badge)
   - **Moderately Active**: 2 visits (üîÑ yellow badge)  
   - **One-Time Visitors**: 1 visit (üÜï blue badge)

3. **Data Synchronization**: When service requests are completed:
   - Customer's total spend is updated
   - Visit history is maintained
   - Service completion triggers customer data updates

## Access Control Maintained

### Staff Portal Access:
- **Service Requests**: Staff can create, edit, view, and delete (with role restrictions)
- **Customers**: Staff can view and edit customer information
- **Customer Deletion**: Restricted to Admin and Manager roles only
- **Service Request Deletion**: Restricted to Admin and Manager roles only

## Database Schema Features

### Customer Schema:
```javascript
{
  name: String (required),
  phone: String (required, unique identifier),
  email: String,
  vehicleModel: String,
  visitCount: Number (default: 1),
  totalSpend: Number (default: 0),
  lastServiceDate: Date,
  category: Virtual field (computed from visitCount)
}
```

### Service Request Schema:
```javascript
{
  customerName: String (required),
  customerPhone: String (required),
  customerId: ObjectId (auto-linked),
  vehicle: String (required),
  serviceType: Enum,
  issue: String (required),
  status: Enum ["Pending", "In Progress", "Completed", "Cancelled"],
  cost: Number (required)
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create Service Requests**: Test with new and existing customer phone numbers
2. **Verify Customer Creation**: Check that customers are auto-created on first service request
3. **Test Visit Count**: Create multiple service requests for same phone number
4. **Category Filtering**: Verify filter works correctly for different visit counts
5. **Permission Testing**: Ensure staff can access service requests but not delete customers

## Files Modified

1. `components/service-requests.tsx` - Fixed API endpoints and response handling
2. `components/customers.tsx` - Enhanced UI with categories, removed Add button
3. Backend routes already properly implemented in:
   - `crm-backend/routes/serviceRequests.js`
   - `crm-backend/routes/customers.js`
   - `crm-backend/models/Customer.js`

The system now provides a seamless workflow where staff can create service requests, and customers are automatically managed in the background with proper categorization and visit tracking.
